description: Where to find Vespera's release notes and version history.
---

Vespera publishes each package independently with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets),
so every release has its own notes. Releases are automated — when changes land on `main`, a bot
opens a "Version Packages" PR; merging it publishes to npm (via OIDC trusted publishing, with
build provenance) and cuts a GitHub Release per package.

## Where to find release notes

- **GitHub Releases** — notes for every published version:
  [github.com/forgialabs/vespera-ui/releases](https://github.com/forgialabs/vespera-ui/releases)
- **Per-package changelogs** — each package has a `CHANGELOG.md` in the repo
  (e.g. [`packages/react/CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/forgialabs/vespera-ui/blob/main/packages/react/CHANGELOG.md)).
- **npm** — version history for any package, e.g.
  [npmjs.com/package/@vespera-ui/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vespera-ui/react?activeTab=versions).

## Versioning

Vespera follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Packages are versioned
independently — a change to `@vespera-ui/react` doesn't bump `@vespera-ui/css` unless the change
touches it. While Vespera is pre-1.0, minor versions may include breaking changes; check the
release notes before upgrading.

## Contributing a changelog entry

If you send a PR that affects a published package, add a changeset describing it — that text
becomes the release note. See [Contributing](https://github.com/forgialabs/vespera-ui/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#changesets).
